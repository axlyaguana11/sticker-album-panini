# How many sticker packages should I open to fully complete Panini's World Cup Album?

In this repo, I simulate 1000 times the opening of packages with Panini's World Cup Album 2022.

I considered the following:

* Each sticker is randomly assigned to a package.
* The sampling is with replacement. So that, we have duplicates.
* Basically, this is a bootstrapping approach.

Album and packages features:

* To complete the album, you should collect 638 different stickers.
* There are other 80 additional stickers. They are not part of the main collection. So I didn't considered them here.
* Each package comes with 5 stickers inside.
* The price of each package varies from country to country. In my case (Ecuador) it's 0.80 USD.
